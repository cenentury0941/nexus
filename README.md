## Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZPh4Wt0fhc

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind Nexus stems from the need for leaders to thrive in an interconnected world. Recognizing the challenges leaders face in navigating complexities, Nexus aims to provide a holistic solution by integrating AI and fostering a platform that encourages diverse perspectives.

## What it does
Nexus is a next-gen AI-driven social media platform designed exclusively for the leaders of tomorrow. It facilitates the sharing of ideas, ideals, and success stories that highlight the positive impact of embracing new perspectives, unbiased thought processes, and equitable ideals. The platform is centered around leadership qualities such as appreciation, empowerment, and constructive discussion.

## How I built it
Nexus is built using a robust technology stack:

- **Frontend:** Developed using ReactJS for a seamless and responsive user interface.

- **AI Integration:** Harnessing the power of OpenAI GPT-4 for advanced language processing and content analysis.

- **Backend:** Leveraging Firebase for scalable and efficient backend services.

## What's next for Nexus
The journey of Nexus doesn't end here. The future holds exciting possibilities, including:

- Continuous AI advancements for enhanced bias detection.

- Integration with external tools or platforms to broaden its impact.

- Establishing a robust feedback mechanism for user insights and platform improvement.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
